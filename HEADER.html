		<h1><a href="ASM.php">Current Version</a></h1>
		<ul>
			<h3>Currently implemented:</h3>
			<li>Tabbed switching between four schedules.
			<li>Nearly full cascade style searching. (Instructor, Department, Course Number, Start time, Core Fulfillment).
			<li>Two seperate and independent search menus.
			<li>Tutorial is in and accessible from the top right of the screen.
			<li>Adding classes to multiple schedules using the checkbox's associated with each schedule results.
			<li>Hitting the print button puts the current schedule into a printable version and opens the built in browser print.
			<li>All times are displayed according to the international standard notation of time: 24-hour clock.
			<li>Classes are now removed from the schedule by clicking a red X.
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<h3>Not yet implemented:</h3>
			<li>Possibly redo the "checkbox" idea to something more intuitive.
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<h3>Current bugs:</h3>
			<li>At some point after adding multiple classes, subsequent classes will cease to be in any color.
			<li>I was able to add classes to the schedule in a way that did not cycle through colors correctly and ran out of colors. I was also able to have three classes on a schedule with two of them in the same color. (AB)
			<li>The department listing is not in alphabetical order like cascade.
		</ul>
